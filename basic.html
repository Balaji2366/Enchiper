    <h1>Describing myself</h1>
    <p>I am Balaji K from Tiruppur. I am passionate about web development and love to create beautiful and functional websites. In my free time, I enjoy reading tech blogs and exploring new technologies.</p>
    <h3>Why do I Want to learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>I want to learn HTML because it is the foundation of all websites and web applications. Every webpage we see on the internet is built using HTML structure. By learning HTML, I can understand how websites are created from scratch and how text, images, links, videos, and forms are displayed on a browser. It is the first and most important step for anyone who wants to enter the field of web development.</p>

<p>Learning HTML will also help me improve my technical and creative skills. With HTML, I can design my own web pages, build simple projects, and present my ideas in a digital format. It allows me to organize content properly and make information easy to read and understand. This skill will be very useful for my studies, projects, and future presentations.</p>

<p>Moreover, HTML is essential for many career opportunities in today’s digital world. It is required for jobs like web developer, UI/UX designer, digital marketer, and software engineer. Knowing HTML will make it easier for me to learn other technologies like CSS, JavaScript, and React. By learning HTML, I am building a strong foundation for my future career in the IT industry.</p>
